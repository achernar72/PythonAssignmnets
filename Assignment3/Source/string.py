#in order to write a python program for the string  and convert it to the list of items.
#python code
#In orde to take a string from the console we have to use this function called input.
string = input("Enter a string:")
#now we have to make the entered string into the list and then we convert them into tuples.
#so for that we have to do the list and then tuple and then print the final answer
# point 1 if you observe we can see that for tuple it is using the () open brackets
print(tuple(list(string)))
#point 2 if you observe we can see that for list it is using the square brackets []
print(list(string))
